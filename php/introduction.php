            <br>
            It is about capturing motion - movement of people, animals, clouds, shadows, waves, traffic, <br>
                reflection, vegetation, among many others.
            <br>
            It is about capturing rare moments, like lenticular clouds, crepascular light, rainbow, northern lights.
            <br>
